## Inspiration ⚙️
This concept was inspired by the quote "Right to Speak." People are more frightened to express themselves in public because they are fearful of being judged or mocked. However, this application allows people to hide behind the internet's walls and express themselves freely.

## What it does ⚙️
Users can anonymously confess their opinions, and other anonymous users can look at it and respond.

## How we built it 🏡
It is a web application created with **React**, with **MongoDB** serving as the database. In order to handle user requests, we have used **Express.js** and **Node.js** as our backend technology.

## Challenges we ran into 🏃‍♂️
The main challenge that we ran into was the time-management. We were not sure what to make and what kind of technology we would use that will make our project stand out.

## What we learned 💸
We learned so much that will help us perform better in future hackathons. We grasped the concept of teamwork and the need of working with others to create wonderful projects and manage time.

## What's next for Confezz 😎
We are considering expanding this idea to university students and a larger platform, i.e., the world, so that they may express their feelings and, if others feel the same and want to help, they can communicate and come up with a solution.
